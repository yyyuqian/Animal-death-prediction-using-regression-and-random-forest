    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on data understanding and preparation for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The problem and data come from an animal shelter concerned with animal welfare and reducing the risk of animal death. The shelter wants to use the data collected about their animals to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction to help them in their planning towards improving the welfare of the animals they shelter. The shelter collects some data for each animal they take in (columns in the dataset with keyword \"intake\") and also records the status of each animal when it left the shelter (columns in the dataset with keyword \"outcome\").\n",
    "The target variable to predict is a binary variable called **binary_outcome**. For this variable, the value “1” indicates that after intake, the animal outcome was negative, e.g., \"death\", while the value \"0\" indicates that the animal outcome was a positive one, e.g., was adopted or returned to the owner.\n",
    "The dataset we work with is a sample of the data released by this shelter:\n",
    "https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student will work with a different subset of the data. The CSV file is named using the format: **AnimalWelfareRisk-[your-student-number].csv**, e.g., **AnimalWelfareRisk-12345678.csv** is the data file for a student with number 12345678. You need to work with the CSV file corresponding to your student number. There are 4 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 40% shown as [40].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [40] Prepare a data quality report for your CSV file. Below you have a set of guideline steps to help you in this process.\n",
    "    - Check how many rows and columns your CSV has.\n",
    "    - Print the first and the last 5 rows.\n",
    "    - Convert the features to their appropriate data types (e.g., decide which features are more appropriate as \n",
    "    continuos and which ones as categorical types). \n",
    "    - Drop duplicate rows and columns, if any.\n",
    "    - Drop constant columns, if any.\n",
    "    - Save your updated/cleaned data frame to a new csv file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    For the updated CSV and data frame (after column/row removal):\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Plot histograms for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot box plots for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot bar plots for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Discuss your initial findings.\n",
    "    - Save the initial discussion of your findings into a single data quality report PDF file.                     The PDF report should focus on the key issues identified in the data and discuss potential strategies              to handle them. Simple listing of tables and plots without discussion of findings will not receive full marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2). [30] Prepare a data quality plan for the cleaned CSV file. \n",
    "    - Mark down all the features where there are potential problems or data quality issues.\n",
    "    - Propose solutions to deal with the problems identified. Explain why did you choose one solution over \n",
    "    potentially many other. It is very important to provide justification for your thinking in this part and to list potential solutions, including the solution that will be implemented to clean the data.\n",
    "    - Apply your solutions to obtain a new CSV file where the identified data quality issues were addressed. \n",
    "    - Save the new CSV file with a self explanatory name. \n",
    "    - Save the data quality plan to a single PDF file.\n",
    "        \n",
    "(3). [15] Exploring relationships between feature pairs:\n",
    "    - Choose a subset of features you find promising and plot pairwise feature interactions (e.g., \n",
    "    continuous-continuous feature plot or continuous-categorical plots or correlation plots). \n",
    "    Explain your choices.\n",
    "    - Discuss your findings from the plots above. Do you find any features or feature combinations that are \n",
    "    indicative of the target outcome? Explain in plain words (a short paragraph) the story of your\n",
    "    findings so far.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [15] Transform, extend or combine the existing features to create a few new features (at least 3) with the aim to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome. Justify the steps and choices you are making. Add these features to your clean dataset and save it as a CSV file with a self explanatory name. "
